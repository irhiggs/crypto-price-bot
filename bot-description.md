# Crypto Price Bot

This is very simple bot that will report the current CoinGecko price of a crypto coin. It's triggered by placing a $ in
front of the coin name, symbol, or id. Values are in USD.

## Examples

**Hey guys, I bought 2 $ETH on Binance**  
*Ethereum is worth $5.*

**You paid too much for $ethereum, I got $algo for way less.**  
*Ethereum is worth $410.44. Algorand is worth $0.652417.*

## Supported coins

Too many to list, seriously, but they were last imported 2020/08/20 from CoinGecko.
